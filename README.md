## Mobile Architect

### 1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The purpose of the weight tracking application is to help users reach their desired target weight within the desired time frame. The weight tracking application has three screens: Login, view weight, and enter weight. It is designed for users who like to work towards a goal for their own type of weight management.

### 2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The weight tracking application supports user needs by having three main screens for the user to see their daily progress:
- **Login Screen**: Allows users to log in to an existing account or create a new account.
- **View Weight Screen**: Displays the user's weight entry for each day the user has entered it.
- **Enter Weight Screen**: Allows users to use the input box and save button to either enter a new weight entry or edit an old weight entry.

The design is simple and easy to navigate, making a great first impression on the users.

### 3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The application follows an iterative approach to both design and code. I relied on information and skills gained from course material and the [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com) website to guide me through the process of designing the weight tracking application. These resources explained how to understand and use Android Studio properly.

### 4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I ensured the code was functional and error-free by running and testing the application. This is crucial to avoid any security weaknesses. Android Studio's debugger feature helped test the code to ensure the application was behaving correctly.

### 5. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Designing a mobile app is not an easy task, but using the layout editor in Android Studio helped me create all the layouts for my application more efficiently and effectively, bringing the application to life more easily.

### 6. In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The textbook material and the [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com) website were instrumental to my success in this course. My understanding of the Java programming language and Android Studio helped build my skills, allowing me to create buttons, databases, and objects within the
